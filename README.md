# Starbucks Customer Analysis

## Overview

This project presents an analysis of Starbucks customer data, where I generated random data using Python, cleaned it using Excel, and performed analysis using R. The study focuses on understanding customer demographics, purchasing behavior, product performance, and store performance.

## Data Generation & Processing

Data Source: The dataset was created using Python to simulate real-world Starbucks transactions.
Data Cleaning:
- Handled missing values using Excel.
- Converted data types and created relevant segmentation columns.
- Ensured consistency in numerical and categorical values.
- Analysis & Visualization: Conducted in R using tidyverse, ggplot2, and other data visualization libraries.

## Key Analyses

1. Customer Demographics Analysis

Segmented customers into age groups and income categories.

Visualized membership distribution across age groups.

Found that older customers (36+) tend to prefer the Gold membership tier.

Insight: The Gold tier is more popular among senior customers, indicating that benefits of this tier may resonate more with an older demographic.

2. Purchase Timing Analysis

Analyzed hourly transaction trends.

Identified peak purchase hours, with notable spikes in morning and early evening transactions.

Insight: Starbucks experiences high sales during commuting hours, suggesting targeted promotions for those times.

3. Product Performance Analysis

Ranked drinks by total revenue and sales volume.

Found Cold Brew to be the most popular item, followed by Espresso-based drinks.

Insight: While Cold Brew generates the most revenue, seasonal drinks might have fluctuating performance worth analyzing further.

4. Customer Value Analysis

Segmented customers into Low, Medium, High, and Very High value groups based on spending.

Analyzed correlation between age and total spending.

Insight: High-value customers are mostly aged 30-50, indicating a strong middle-aged customer base.

5. Store Performance Analysis

Compared total revenue and average transactions across store locations.

Identified the best-performing store locations based on sales, with mall stores outperforming standalone stores.

Insight: High foot-traffic locations such as malls contribute significantly to Starbucks revenue.
